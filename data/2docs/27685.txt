Hospital Administrative Services c.o.b. Plexxus ("Plexxus") is a not-for-profit corporation created for the purpose of providing services to its 12 hospital members. Plexxus is issuing this RFP subject to the provisions of the AIT Annex 502.4 and will administer the RFP procedure set forth herein for the benefit and on behalf of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, "SHSC" (the "Hospital").
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is one of Canada's largest and most dynamic hospitals. The hospital's 10,000 staff, physicians and volunteers provide the best care for over 1 million patients each year.
Clinicians and researchers in Canada have convened to launch a bold new collaborative initiative called the Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN). CAIN is a pan-canadian imaging network funded through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Canada Foundation for Innovation. This unique research network is focused on the pathobiology of atherosclerosis, a disease affecting blood vessels that result in strokes and heart attacks. In developing and utilizing highly advanced imaging technologies through an integrative approach, they hope to prevent the negative outcomes of atherosclerosis. Large scale clinical trials will be conducted to understand its natural history, correlations between different vascular systems, imaging biomarkers, and links to patient outcomes. The CAIN network will require up-to-date ultrasound imaging to fully support this exciting endeavour.
This Request for Proposal ("RFP") is being issued on behalf of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, the "Hospital".
