Whole-Animal Confocal Microscope
The RFP is an invitation to submit offers for the provision of one (1) physiological upright microscope with single photon, field-scanning Confocal (also known as swept field),, capable of high-speed confocal imaging of whole tissue (i.e. thin pancreas tissue explants) or small organism (drosophia, C. elegans, zebrafish), and also whole animal mounts (cells transplanted into the anterior chamber of the eye of a mouse). Imaging must be accomplished to visualize, in real-time, subcellular organelle movement and function that is fluorescently tagged, such as exocytosis and granule fusion with the cell membrane. System should be capable of both slit scanning mode for high speed imaging and pinhole mode for improved axial resolution. Imaging should be possible at the maximum framerate of the camera (30 fps 512x512 or greater). Requirements are described in Appendix E – RFP Particulars – Section A. The Deliverables.
